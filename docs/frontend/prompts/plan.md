hello
I am working on a proejct named casabrick buynoida project for which i am goign to use the react + vite for the frontend and this will be working with the restul ful api backend 
which will be iplemented later
and by another team
so for this you have to prepare a proper outlined plan of action which has to be formed
>
Role " you have to act as expert in frontend development, docuemntation and well maintiable code written in suitable programmng language project is already setup with tailwindcss for styling and jsx code in modular well formed manner
and maintain the documentation only in docs/** folder
.. since it will be deplyed in well versed manner so you have to maintain mutliple level of logging and depending upon the environemtn varibles
>>
also mke sure to add proper configuration management of the project 
.. all the details of the project is given below which you can understand
>. s
so what you have to do is 
1. create a well structed docuemnt named as proejct.md 
which contain overall project requirement from frontend side
..
and the tools and technolgoies which we have to use for them
>>
and once the plan of action is completed i will be providing you with the access of the figma design of the website which you can implement in well formed manner
..
or the screen hsot which is favorblae from your side
..
setup axios for the communcaiton of api related ones. and also make sure to use the clean writing code approach
modular not wriiting the whole code in a single file
>> follow the compoents approach, lib and other well organized folder architecutre so maultipe teams can collaobrate poreprly in well origanized manner
>>
and after going through the docuemnt first you have to make the documentaiton , key requriements and libraries which we are going to use .
browse web to ensure no depcreated packages are being used
..
and also make sure to wirte the action plan for the coding agent which can write the code for it later in proepr maner
and following the best approach for this solution
>
and then maintain the phases approch to divide the whoile project from frontend side into phases
so we can implennt them one by one and 
>> keep the documentation well structed not repating same things again and again>>
for clean and well written approach
>>
and taken inconsider of security poitn of view for authentication and all>>
.. to ensure seamless working of sultion
>>
adn remove the already written code and color options which are just for the coming soon page with ..
the new design will be provided with poper description>
>>
hence start from a fresh approach.
>>
peorform the steps given above.
